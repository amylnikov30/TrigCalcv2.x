# TrigCalcv2.x
Advanced Trigonometric Calculator made in C# with the .NET Framework. Makes use of fractions and can switch between radian and degree calculation, supporting fractions in both modes.

## Documentation
> To write a fraction, use the division notation: `{numerator}/{denominator}`
> To use π, use the same notation, but write `pi` in the numerator: `{numerator}(pi)/{denominator}`. Note that the parentheses around `pi` must be present.
> Note that to write a fraction where the numerator is only π, `1` needs to be explicitly multiplied: `1(pi)/3`
